# Asteroid_Blaster_Game
 A top-down 2D arcade project game made in Godot!

## How it was made:
I made this over the course of weekend to try out the Godot game engine. Godot has a few languages it supports, but I opted to use it native GDScript, which is similar to python.
The entirety of this project was solo developed by me, the exception being the creation of the assets, as I wanted to focus on game creation rather than creating the art, music, and such.

## How to play:
Use the WASD keys to move, and left mouse click to fire.

## Assets I used:
Background: [Seamless Space Backgrounds by Screaming Brain Studios (itch.io](https://screamingbrainstudios.itch.io/seamless-space-backgrounds)
