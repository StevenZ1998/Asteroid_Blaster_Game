# Asteroid_Blaster_Game
 A top-down 2D arcade project game made in Godot!

## How it was made:
I made this over the course of weekend to try out the Godot game engine. Godot has a few languages it supports, but I opted to use it native GDScript, which is similar to python.
The entirety of this project was solo developed by me, the exception being the creation of the assets, as I wanted to focus on game creation rather than creating the art, music, and such.

## Is the game playable?
While the game does in fact work, I have not done anything to make this easily playable. That being said, one **CAN** play the game by pulling the files and running it straight from the Godot editor.
